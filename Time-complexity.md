# LRU Cache

1. For `_handle_max_capacity` function, time complexity is `O(n)` as I am using for loop as well min function, to go through all the elements.
2. For rest of the functions, time complexity is `O(1)` as it's simple insertion and deletion operation in the dictionary.

# File recursion

The time complexity for this is `O(n)` As it's standard for recursive functions

# Huffman coding

As I am sorting elements as well as using recursion and iteration through the encoding section, the time complexity is `O(nlog(n)))`

# Active Directory

As I am using recursive function, the time complexity is `O(n)`

# Blockchain

As I am using simple linked list, the time complexity is `O(n)`

# Union and Intersection

I am using union and intersection of sets. Hence the time complexity is `O(log(n))`
